13th Age (RPG) Battle Helper

Working demo: http://evyatar.amitay.me/playground/13th/

HowTo's
-------

This app has 2 modes - Editor and Reader:

* The **Editor** controls the battle - changing the Escalation Die and the players' and monsters' initiatives.
* The **Reader** only recieves the changes made by the Editor.

Editor:
---------

1.  Open [the link](http://evyatar.amitay.me/playground/13th/) on your phone/tablet/laptop.
2.  Do an action to create a battle - Enter your players and their initiatives or change the escalation die.
3.  At this point you'll have a battle - you can see a _Link_ next to the title "Battle".
4.  This link will open your current battle in Reader mode.
5.  **PLEASE NOTE** that once an Editor closes his edit screen there's **no way** to change the battle.

Reader:
-------

1.  Get the reader link from the Editor (step 3 above)
2.  Open said link on a large screen visible to the entire party

Now each change made by the Editor will propagate to all other Readers.
